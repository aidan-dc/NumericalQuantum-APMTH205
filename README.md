# NumericalQuantum-APMTH205

This is a small repository to house the code I wrote for my final project in my numerical methods (Applied Math 205) during my G2 year.

The code is largely based around a function `discretized_schrodinger` to discretize a 1D potential and solve for the eigenstates and eigenvalues. The function itself and a short example can be found under [main-notebook.ipynb](main-notebook.ipynb).

For more details about the process behind the function, its application, and some more examples consult the written report [project-paper.pdf](project-paper.pdf). All figures produced for the paper can be found under the [figures](figures) folder, and were produced using code found in the (uncommented) [paper-figures.ipynb](paper-figures.ipynb) notebook.
